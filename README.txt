***all codes are in the folder code_project well comented.
***the project use [appdesigner] GUI instead of guide GUI thats why all pages are app matlab extension(the same features just that appdesigner is well performed).
***to create a new app just tap;appdesigner--------
****To run the project you need only to run the app main_page and follow the steps in video.
***the video it tooks less than 10min due to the content and information
i could not make less because it was a litle hard since it contains multiple parts and
it was hard to record again with one less of 5 min
***codage_presentation:ppt used in video
***in the record it may appears some latency in app execution ,the reason is due to version of matlab and the computer used,but normally the code works well.

Thanks for your time.
Best Regards
