# Compression Coding

## Overview

This project uses MATLAB's App Designer GUI instead of the GUIDE GUI for a more enhanced and efficient user experience. All the source code is well-commented and located in the `code_project` folder.

## Features

- **App Designer GUI**:
  - The project utilizes MATLAB's App Designer GUI, which offers the same features as GUIDE but with improved performance.
  - To create a new app, simply type `appdesigner` in the MATLAB command window.

## Running the Project

1. **Run the Main App**:
   - To run the project, open MATLAB and run the `main_page` app.
   - Follow the steps provided in the accompanying video tutorial.

2. **Video Tutorial**:
   - The video tutorial is less than 10 minutes long and covers all the necessary steps and information.
   - Due to the detailed content and multiple parts, the video could not be made shorter without losing essential information.

## Presentation

- **Codage Presentation**:
  - The PowerPoint presentation (`codage_presentation.ppt`) used in the video is included in the project files.

## Notes

- **Latency in App Execution**:
  - Some latency may be observed in the app execution during the recorded video. This is due to the MATLAB version and the computer used for recording. Normally, the code works well without significant latency.

## Conclusion

Thanks for your time.
